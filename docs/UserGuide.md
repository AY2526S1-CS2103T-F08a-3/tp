## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `clear` and `toggle`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`

* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
After using the `find` command, you can use the new index numbers shown on screen for commands that require index as an input, such as [`edit`](#editing-a-person--edit) or [`ap`](#adding-an-appointment--ap).
</div>

Examples:
* `find Alex` returns all persons named 'Alex' (and anyone with 'Alex' in other details)
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="images/findAlexResult.png" alt="result for 'find Alex'" width="90%">
</div>
<br>
* `find Alex David` returns all persons named 'Alex' **or** 'David' (and anyone with 'Alex' or 'David' in other details)

  <img src="images/findAlexDavidResult.png" alt="result for 'find Alex David'" width="90%">
</div>
<br>

### Deleting a person : `delete`

* Deleting a person will also delete all their associated appointments.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
* The `INDEX` is the index number shown in the current or most recently displayed person list. This may be different from the index number in the full person list. If you wish to use the index from the full person list, don't forget to use `list` before using `delete`.
* Deleting a person will also delete all their associated appointments.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Use the [`find`](#locating-persons-by-name-find) command to easily locate the contact that you wish to delete.
</div>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book. 
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 5px;">
  <img src="images/listResult.png" alt="result for 'list'" width="49%">
  <img src="images/delete2Result.png" alt="result for 'delete 2'" width="49%">
</div>
<br>

* `find irfan` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 5px;">
  <img src="images/findIrfanResult.png" alt="result for `find irfan`" width="49%">

* To create an appointment with only a seller, simply omit the `b/` tag. 
* The indices refer to the index numbers shown in the displayed person list which will be a positive whole number (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...)
* Provide a client that has the role `seller` and an optional client that has the role `buyer`.
* Provide the datetime in an ISO 8601-compliant format. (e.g. `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm`)
* The seller's location is automatically displayed as the appointment location. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
It is possible to add multiple appointments at the same time. Appointments will only be regarded as duplicate if they have the same datetime, seller, and buyer (or lack of buyer).
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Use the [`find`](#locating-persons-by-name-find) command with multiple keywords (such as `find Alex David`) to easily index the contacts you wish to create an appointment for.
</div>

Examples:
*  `ap d/2025-12-01T12:00 s/4 b/1` adds an appointment with seller (index 4: Roy) and buyer (index 1: Alex) on 1 Dec 2025 at 12pm. `lap` can be used to view appointments after adding.
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 5px;">
  <img src="images/apResult.png" alt="result for `ap d/2025-12-01T12:00 s/4 b/1`" width="49%">

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing an appointment : `eap`

Edits an existing appointment in the displayed appointment list.

Format: `eap APPOINTMENT_INDEX [d/DATETIME] [s/SELLER_INDEX] [b/BUYER_INDEX]`

Examples:
* `lap` followed by `eap 1 d/2025-01-15T14:00` changes the datetime of the 1st appointment to 15 Jan 2025 at 2pm.
* `lap` followed by `eap 2 s/3` changes the seller of the 2nd appointment to the 3rd person in the person list.
* `lap` followed by `eap 1 d/2025-02-01T10:00 b/4` changes both the datetime and buyer of the 1st appointment.

### Saving the data

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ClientSquare will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ClientSquare to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ClientSquare home folder.<br><br>
**Q**: How do I backup my data?<br>
**A**: Simply copy the `data/ClientSquare.json` file from your data folder to a safe location. This file contains all your client and appointment information.<br><br>
**Q**: Can I have multiple appointments with the same client?<br>
**A**: Yes, you can schedule multiple appointments with the same buyer or seller. Each appointment is tracked separately by date and time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
