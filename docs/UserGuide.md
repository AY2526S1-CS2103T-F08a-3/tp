## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `clear` and `toggle`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Warnings:
* The `INDEX` is the index number shown in the current or most recently displayed person list. This may be different from the index number in the full person list. If you wish to use the index from the full person list, don't forget to use `list` before using `delete`.

Tips:
* Use the [`find`](#locating-persons-by-name-find) command to easily locate the contact that you wish to delete.

### Adding an appointment : `ap`

Adds an appointment with a seller and a buyer. 

Format: `ap SELLER_INDEX d/DATETIME b/BUYER_INDEX`

* The indices refer to the index numbers shown in the displayed person list. This will be a positive whole number, such as 1, 2, 3, ...
* Datetime should be in an ISO 8601-compliant format (e.g. `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss`) and must be provided.

* Deletes an appointment with the **seller** specified by `INDEX`, and the specified `DATETIME`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. This will be a positive whole number, such as 1, 2, 3, ...
* Datetime should match exactly with the appointment's datetime in an ISO 8601-compliant format (e.g. `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss`) and must be provided.

### Saving the data

### Editing the data file

ClientSquare data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/ClientSquare.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ClientSquare will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ClientSquare to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ClientSquare home folder.<br><br>
**Q**: How do I backup my data?<br>
**A**: Simply copy the `data/ClientSquare.json` file from your data folder to a safe location. This file contains all your client and appointment information.<br><br>
**Q**: Can I have multiple appointments with the same client?<br>
**A**: Yes, you can schedule multiple appointments with the same buyer or seller. Each appointment is tracked separately by date and time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
