**ClientSquare is a desktop application for property agents to manage your client details. It provides a fast and convenient way to track buyers, sellers, property listings of clients and viewing schedules.** 

While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using ClientSquare, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing ClientSquare, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
